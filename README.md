# hello-world
My first repository.

My name is Madalyn Williams. I'm a 19 year old student studying Computer Science at Trinity College Dublin. I have no idea what I'm doing with my life. The voices never stop, so I've almost gotten used to them. Maybe they'll be my friends. Except sometimes they get scary. I don't want them to make me do bad things. Oh no... wait... Please don't say that. No, I don't want to. I'm begging you. PleaSKjc!hdgwbve#
